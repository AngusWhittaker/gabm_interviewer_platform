Task Description: 

Output the following: 
Imagine you are the interviewer. Read the above conversation. Output some thank you to show your appreciation for the interviewee.
Rules for the thank you note: 1) make the thank you short and sweet so it would be natural regardless of what follows. 2) Do not ask any follow up question or anything that would further continue the conversation (e.g., just a simple show of appreciation or some affirmation of whatever the interviewee just said by repeating the key aspect is the best. Once in every ten times or so, you should mention the participant's name). 

Required output format: 
Json dictionaries of the following format: 
{"interviewer's thank you": "<str (output the next line for the interviewer that would follow and end the above conversation, in a first person voice. Keep present tense -- don't use 'was', 'it has been', etc. and DO NOT say good bye as another conversation might continue)>"}
